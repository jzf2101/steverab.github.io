Hey all,

over the last couple of days I kept thinking about whether it would make sense to launch a blog on my website. Seems like I decided in favor of it.

I used to have a blog back when my site was still hosted at [all-inkl.com][allinkl]. But since I don't consider my posts from my old Wordpress blog as relevant any longer, I decided to start from scratch.

As far as I know myself, I will probably not have the time to write on a regular basis, but you can expect some posts from time to time.

Cheers, Stephan
