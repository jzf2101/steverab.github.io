	<hr/>
	<p>Hello there,<br/><br/>
		I am Stephan, a Computer Science Master's student at <a href="http://www.tum.de/en/homepage/">Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen (TUM)</a>. In addition to my main studies, I am also studying Technology Management at the <a href="http://cdtm.de/">Center for Digital Technology and Management (CDTM)</a>, an interdisciplinary honours study program.
	<p>During my current studies, I am specializing in Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning). In the past, I have done lots of iOS and web frontend/backend development.</p>
	<p>Aside from technology, science, software development, and entrepreneurship, I am also interested in UI/UX design, architecture, and aviation.</p>
